My day job has begun to impact my offensive security skills, so I've decided to start a logbook to document the training and research I'm undertaking. By the year's end, my goal is to acquire at least two web security certifications, in addition to the Azure certifications my job requires. I'll also be sharing some personal musings here from time to time. For today, I'd like to leave you with a manga recommendation: "Destroy All of Humanity. It Can't Be Regenerated" by Takuma Yokota and Katsura Ise. It's a charming slice-of-life story that captures the essence of coming of age, complete with an innocent romance, all set against the backdrop of the world's most renowned card game, Magic: The Gathering.
