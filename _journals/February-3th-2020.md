My day job has begun to impact my learning on offensive security, so I've decided to start a logbook to document the training and research I'm undertaking. By the year's end, my goal is to acquire at least two web security certifications, in addition to the Azure certifications my job requires. I'll also be sharing some personal musings here from time to time. For today, I'd like to leave you with a manga recommendation: "Destroy All of Humanity. It Can't Be Regenerated" by Takuma Yokota and Katsura Ise. It's a charming slice-of-life, coming of age, with an innocent romance story, all set against the backdrop of the world's most renowned card game, Magic: The Gathering.
